 I try to predict how many medals a country will win at the Olympic based on 
past performance using machine learning. As you know the Information Technology (IT) has been 
a major tool in the organization of the Olympic Games in the past century. This has been due to 
the technological developments that have been seen in the IT sector. One of the main departments 
that IT has been used in the Olympic Games is the ticketing department. On the other hand, 
nowadays IT has a significant impact to guest the winner of Olympic games. We can predict the 
accurate result by using machine learning. In this project, I try to predict the winner of Olympic 
games by using different library of machine learninng.
